# SimpleRK4
WIP C++ implementation of a 4th-order Runge-Kutta numerical solver for systems of 1st order differential equations. 

# Description
Accepts arbitrary number and type of equations as input; useful for state-space representations of dynamical systems. See demo code for a usage example.

# How to use
Still considering adding or modifying functionality.
