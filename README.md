# SimpleRK4
C++ implementation of a 4th-order Runge-Kutta numerical solver for systems of 1st order differential equations. 

# Description
Accepts arbitrary number and type of equations as input, returns vector of variable values over time; useful for state-space representations of dynamical systems. 

# How to use
For now, see demo code for a usage example.
